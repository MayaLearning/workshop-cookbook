# workshop-cookbook

To run: 
```
terraform init
terraform apply -parallelism=${DESIRED_PARALLELISM} --var 'cluster_count=${NUM_CLUSTERS}'
```

About the `-parallelism` flag: The default is 8. I'm guessing that the scripts will run more quickly the larger you set it. I've been setting it to 1200 (more than the number of resources being created). 

Requirements:
- Public and private key in the root directory of the project. The public key should have permissions 644 and be called id_rsa.pub, and the private key should have permissions 600 and be called id_rsa. 
- Appropriate AWS EC2 vCPU, VPC, and EIP limits for us-east-2 or whichever aws region you'd like provision the clusters in. 

Notes: 
- It shouldn't take more than an hour to run these scripts in the worst case. Ideally, the running the scripts should complete after 15 minutes. 
- It might take around 7 minutes for the bootstrap process (`module.workshop[43].null_resource.wait_for_bootstrap_to_finish`) on the nodes to finish....
- These scripts will isolate each cluster inside it's own VPC.
